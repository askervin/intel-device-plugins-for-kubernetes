# CRI tests runner

This directory contains helpers to run
[`critest`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/blob/master/docs/validation.md)
from [cri-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/) to
make sure that various `cri-resmgr` configurations do not break CRI
runtime conformance.
